This is a my collection of LaTeX tempates that I use for writing alsmost all my documents. So far it includes two files: one for single-lingual 
purposes and one for multi-lingual purposes.

Common Packages
=====================

This list includes packages that are pre-loaded in every template:

* `mathtools`
* `enumitem` (with the `inline` option)
