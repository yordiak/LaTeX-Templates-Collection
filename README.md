This is a my collection of LaTeX tempates that I use for writing alsmost all my documents. So far it includes two files: one for single-lingual 
purposes and one for multi-lingual purposes.

Common Packages and Configuration
====================================

This list includes packages that are pre-loaded in every template:

* `mathtools`, `amssymb` and `amsthm`
* `enumitem` 
* `biblatex`
* `xpatch`
* `abstract`
* `xcolor`
* declaring `min/max` math operators
* redefining `eqref` command and the `abstract` and `title` environments
* creating `lemma`, `proposition` and `definition` environments

Template-related Packages
